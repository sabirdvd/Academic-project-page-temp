# Research Website Template

This folder includes a reusable academic project website template.

## Template File

- `project_temp.html`: A clean starter page with placeholders for title, authors,
  figures, tables, and key results. It includes a light-by-default theme toggle.

## Quick Start

1. Copy the template:
   - `cp project_temp.html my_project.html`
2. Replace placeholders:
   - Title, authors, affiliations, links, abstract, and section text.
   - Figure files: `figure_1.png`, `figure_2.png`, `figure_3.png`, `figure_4.png`.
3. Update tables:
   - Rename metrics and model names to match your project.
   - Replace sample values with your results.
4. Update citation and contact details.

## Notes

- Images are referenced by filename; keep them in the same folder as the HTML.
- The dark mode toggle is optional; remove the button and script if you do not need it.
